                Music has been a significant part of my life. I’ve been playing the clarinet for six years, starting in high school and continuing through college. I played at church services and weddings. Playing the clarinet allows me to express myself and bring joy to others. It’s more than just an instrument to me—it’s a way to connect with people and create beautiful moments.

                I also love to play piano. I played for my church throughout the three years of high school, and that was one of my most supreme experiences in life. The piano has always been my favorite instrument as a means of relaxation and expressing creativity. Whether I'm improvising or learning new songs, it's a hobby that soothes and brings me joy.

                When I am not playing music, I love to explore video games. My favorite games are Fortnite, Roblox, and Rocket League. Gaming to me is about working with friends, improvising, and having fun. Weekends were always the best time for me to unwind and have fun from friendly competition.

                Cooking has been one of my favorite activities. I love cooking different types of food. My favorite thing to cook is still Jollof rice with meat. These recipes remind me of home and allow me to share my culture with other people.
