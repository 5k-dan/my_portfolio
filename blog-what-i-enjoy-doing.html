                Music has been a significant part of my life. I’ve been playing the clarinet for six years, starting in high school and continuing through college. Whether it's performing at church services or adding a special touch to weddings, playing the clarinet allows me to express myself and bring joy to others. It’s more than just an instrument to me—it’s a way to connect with people and create beautiful moments.

                I also love to play piano. I played for my church throughout the three years of high school, and that was one of my most supreme experiences in life. The piano has always been my favorite instrument as a means of relaxation and expressing creativity. Whether I'm improvising or learning new songs, it's a hobby that soothes and brings me joy.

                When I am not playing music, I love to explore video games. My favorite games are Fortnite, Roblox, and Rocket League. Gaming is not all about winning; it's about working with friends, planning, and having fun. Weekends will be the best time for me to enter these virtual worlds where I can rest and have fun from friendly competition.

                Cooking has been one of my favorite activities. I love cooking different types of food. My favorite thing to cook is still the common Nigerian dishes such as Jollof rice and fufu with pounded yam. These recipes remind me of home and allow me to share my culture with other people.

                I also like to cook American food because it allows me to mix flavors and try new things by making meals such as salmon with rice or fried potatoes. Cooking lets a person be creative in the kitchen and feel good about a well-made meal. Whatever the case, whether I am cooking for myself or for others, there is no time when I don't find joy in cooking.
