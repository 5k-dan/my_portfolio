            I’ve always loved playing the piano since I was a kid. It’s something that brings me peace and allows me to express myself creatively. Basketball has been another passion of mine, as I love the energy and teamwork it fosters. Cooking is something I discovered later in life, but now it’s one of my favorite ways to relax and try new recipes. Running has been a great way for me to stay fit and clear my mind. These hobbies have shaped who I am and keep me grounded.

            Each of these hobbies has given me a unique perspective on life. They remind me to stay active, think creatively, and enjoy the little moments. Whether it’s playing a favorite tune on the piano, scoring a basket, or enjoying a home-cooked meal, I find joy in the simple things.
