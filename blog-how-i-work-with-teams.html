        <h1>How I Work with Teams</h1>

            Collaboration has always been one of my strongest skills. Over the years, I've learned how to work effectively with teams in various settings, from technical projects to community initiatives.

            When working in a team, I believe in open communication. I ensure everyone has a chance to share their thoughts and ideas, which often leads to creative and innovative solutions. For example, during a recent hackathon, my team and I developed a chatbot by combining everyone's expertise—some worked on the front-end, while others focused on the AI model. By clearly dividing tasks and staying connected throughout the project, we successfully delivered a product that exceeded expectations.

            I also value feedback and adaptability. In group settings, I actively seek input from my peers and take constructive criticism to improve the outcome. I’m a firm believer in celebrating successes together and learning from challenges as a team. These principles have helped me build strong, lasting connections with my teammates and achieve great results in every collaboration.
