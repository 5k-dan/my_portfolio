                Collaboration has always been one of my greatest skills. Throughout the years, Iâ€™ve learned how to work well with teams in different situations, from technical projects to community activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                When working in a team, I find <span class="highlight">open conversation</span> very important. I make sure that everyone gets a chance to bring out their thoughts and ideas, which often leads to new and creative solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, in the previous hackathon, my colleagues and I were able to make a chatbot using each of our skills: some worked on the front part, and others on the AI model. As everyone was clear about task sharing and communication during the project, we ended up creating a much better product than expected.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my first week of college, I had the opportunity to join the <span class="highlight">Multicultural Engineering Program</span>. One of our activities involved working in a team to draft a solution to the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989. This project was both challenging and inspiring, as we brainstormed innovative methods for oil spill containment and cleanup.
            </p>
            <p>
                My team worked tirelessly to research the environmental and economic impact of the spill, ultimately presenting a detailed plan that incorporated both technical and community-based solutions. This experience taught me the value of <span class="highlight">diverse perspectives</span> in solving real-world problems and highlighted the power of collaboration in achieving meaningful results.
            </p>
            <p>
                I will also mention <span class="highlight">feedback</span> and flexibility. With groups, I seek from others constructive criticism that helps me deliver improved results. I really believe in celebrating wins together and learning from difficulties as a team. Such ideas have helped me form solid, long-lasting bonds with my team members and deliver excellent project results every time.
