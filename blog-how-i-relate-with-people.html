            <p>
                In my first year of college, I took an online introductory computer science course. While the course itself was interesting, I quickly noticed something was missingâ€”a sense of community. For many students, especially minorities in computer science, the lack of connection made the experience isolating.
            </p>
            <p>
                To address this, I helped start a club called <span class="highlight">Multicultural Innovators in Computer Science</span>. The goal of the club was simple: to create a space where students from diverse backgrounds could come together, share their experiences, and support one another in their computer science journeys. We wanted to bridge the gap that often exists in STEM fields and make sure everyone felt included and empowered.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of our first activities was organizing study groups and networking sessions. These events allowed students to collaborate on projects, exchange ideas, and build friendships that extended beyond the classroom. Over time, the club became a hub for mentorship, career advice, and meaningful discussions about the challenges and opportunities in computer science. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This experience taught me the value of taking initiative and building relationships. By creating a supportive community, we not only helped each other succeed academically but also showed that a shared sense of purpose can bring people closer and inspire positive change.
